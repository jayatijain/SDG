2135,20862,"Every time we plan a trip to a foreign country, it might get overwhelming and a bit complicated. As there are many things to plan for, we might get confused about where to start. But, do not worry, we can help we with it!
 
 While we begin planning our trip, our first step must be to check the validity of our passport and curate all the documents required for international travel. After this, we can start shopping, packing, etc.
 
 As different countries have different document requirements, it is important to check the documents required to visit our destination country before we start arranging our documents. For example, if we travel to the Schengen region, it is mandatory to have travel insurance inclusive of medical insurance.
 
 Therefore, it is advisable to research and keep the travel documents ready to avoid last-minute challenges. We have listed below a few travel documents we would require during our international trip, irrespective of our destination country.
 
 While travelling to another country, it is important to have a passport. If we do not have one, it is advisable to apply for it beforehand so that our application can be processed and be ready in time. And, if we already have a passport, check the expiry date and passport number; it shouldn’t expire in the coming 6 months or until we come back. Furthermore, it is preferable to carry a copy of our passport. On a U.S. passport, the official number is listed on the inside information page alongside our name, birthday, photograph and the passport's expiration date. The number changes each time we get a new passport, so it will be different approximately every 10 years (or any time we renew our passport). It's best to always keep a photocopy of our passport somewhere safe just in case we misplace the actual passport. A good trick is to email ourself that photocopy or save it via a cloud storage service, so we'll always have it on the ready.
 
 Another important requirement during international travel is a visa. It is a stamp on our passport which provides permission to enter another country. However, a few countries provide visa on arrival, and for others, we need to apply for the same in advance. Therefore, while planning our trip, check the visa conditions, and if we cannot obtain an on-arrival visa, it is prudent to apply for a tourist visa in advance, as the process might take some time. Besides, in some cases, the visa might get rejected too.","{""utterances"": [{""utterance"": ""Every time we plan a trip to a foreign country, it might get overwhelming and a bit complicated.

We have listed below a few travel documents we would require during our international trip, irrespective of our destination country.\n \n While travelling to another country, it is important to have a passport. If we do not have one, it is advisable to apply for it beforehand so that our application can be processed and be ready in time. And, if we already have a passport, check the expiry date and passport number; it shouldn\u2019t expire in the coming 6 months or until we come back. Furthermore, it is preferable to carry a copy of our passport. On a U.S. passport, the official number is listed on the inside information page alongside our name, birthday, photograph and the passport's expiration date. The number changes each time we get a new passport, so it will be different approximately every 10 years (or any time we renew our passport). It's best to always keep a photocopy of our passport somewhere safe just in case we misplace the actual passport. A good trick is to email ourself that photocopy or save it via a cloud storage service, so we'll always have it on the ready.\n \n Another important requirement during international travel is a visa. It is a stamp on our passport which provides permission to enter another country. However, a few countries provide visa on arrival, and for others, we need to apply for the same in advance. Therefore, while planning our trip, check the visa conditions, and if we cannot obtain an on-arrival visa, it is prudent to apply for a tourist visa in advance, as the process might take some time. Besides, in some cases, the visa might get rejected too."", ""entityMatches"": [{""beginOffset"": 834, ""endOffset"": 840, ""originalString"": ""minute"", ""matchedEntities"": [{""entityName"": ""DATE_TIME_PII"", ""score"": 1.0, ""value"": {""originalString"": ""minute"", ""name"": ""minute"", ""entityName"": ""DATE_TIME_PII""}}]}, {""beginOffset"": 1304, ""endOffset"": 1312, ""originalString"": ""6 months"", ""matchedEntities"": [{""entityName"": ""DATE_TIME_PII"", ""score"": 1.0, ""value"": {""originalString"": ""6 months"", ""name"": ""6 months"", ""entityName"": ""DATE_TIME_PII""}}]}, {""beginOffset"": 1653, ""endOffset"": 1661, ""originalString"": ""10 years"", ""matchedEntities"": [{""entityName"": ""DATE_TIME_PII"", ""score"": 1.0, ""value"": {""originalString"": ""10 years"", ""name"": ""10 years"", ""entityName"": ""DATE_TIME_PII""}}]}]}]}","DATE_TIME_PII: minute

2148,20740,"Falcone here, Issuer identification number [IIN] The first six or eight digits of a card number (including the initial MII digit) are known as the issuer identification number (IIN). These identify the card issuing institution that issued the card to the card holder. The rest of the number is allocated by the card issuer. The card number’s length is its number of digits. Many card issuers print the entire IIN and account number on their card. In some circumstances, the issuer identification number (IIN) or bank identification number (BIN) may not be licensed directly from the issuing network (such as Mastercard or Visa). Obtaining an IIN/BIN number can be costly, time consuming and demand intensive operational burdens on in-house regulatory and compliance teams. For this reason, some new card programmes may use a 'BIN sponsor', in which case the IIN/BIN number is effectively sub-licensed from a scheme regulated entity. This is known as BIN sponsorship, and is a popular way for financial institutions to fast-track access to the market. To reduce the risk of credit card fraud, various techniques are used to prevent the dissemination of bank card numbers. These include: 1] Format-preserving encryption: in which the account number is replaced with a strongly encrypted version which retains the format of the card data including non sensitive parts of the field such as first six and last four digits. This permits data field protection without changing payment IT systems and applications. A common use is for protecting card data from the point of capture in a secure reader to the payment processing host end-to-end to mitigate risk of data compromise in systems such as the Point of Sale (POS). AES-FF1 Format-Preserving Encryption is defined in NIST Specification SP800-38G. 2] PAN truncation: in which only some of the digits on a card are displayed or printed on receipts. The PCI DSS dictates that only the first six and last four digits of the PAN may be printed on a receipt or displayed in cases other than where a business need requires the full PAN. US federal law allows only the display of the last 5 digits. In order to comply with both PCI DSS requirements and US federal law, generally only the last four digits are provided elsewhere to allow an individual to identify the card used. 3] Tokenization: in which an artificial account number (token) is printed, stored or transmitted in place of the true account number.

These include: 1] Format-preserving encryption: in which the account number is replaced with a strongly encrypted version which retains the format of the card data including non sensitive parts of the field such as first six and last four digits. This permits data field protection without changing payment IT systems and applications. A common use is for protecting card data from the point of capture in a secure reader to the payment processing host end-to-end to mitigate risk of data compromise in systems such as the Point of Sale (POS). AES-FF1 Format-Preserving Encryption is defined in NIST Specification SP800-38G. 2] PAN truncation: in which only some of the digits on a card are displayed or printed on receipts. The PCI DSS dictates that only the first six and last four digits of the PAN may be printed on a receipt or displayed in cases other than where a business need requires the full PAN. US federal law allows only the display of the last 5 digits. In order to comply with both PCI DSS requirements and US federal law, generally only the last four digits are provided elsewhere to allow an individual to identify the card used. 3] Tokenization: in which an artificial account number (token) is printed, stored or transmitted in place of the true account number.
